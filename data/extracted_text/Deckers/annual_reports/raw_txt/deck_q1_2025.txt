CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for our first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 (Quarterly Report), and the information and documents incorporated by
reference within this Quarterly Report, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), which statements are subject to considerable risks and
uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements other than statements of historical fact contained in, or incorporated by reference within, this
Quarterly Report. We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” or “would,” and similar expressions or the negative of these expressions. Specifically, this Quarterly Report, and
the information and documents incorporated by reference within this Quarterly Report, contain forward-looking statements relating to, among other things:
• changes in consumer preferences impacting our brands and products, and the footwear and fashion industries;
• global economic trends, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in interest rates, inflationary pressures, changes in
commodity pricing, and recessionary concerns;
• the ability to effectively compete in a highly competitive footwear, apparel, and accessories industry;
• our business, operating, investing, capital allocation, marketing, and financing plans and strategies;
• the operational challenges faced by our warehouses and distribution centers (DCs), wholesale partners, global third-party logistics providers
(3PLs), and third-party carriers, including as a result of global supply chain disruptions and labor shortages;
• trends, seasonality, and weather impacting the demand for our products and the purchasing behavior of wholesale partners and consumers;
• changes to the geographic and seasonal mix of our brands and products;
• availability of materials and manufacturing capacity, and reliability of overseas production and storage;
• changes to our product distribution strategies, including product allocation and segmentation strategies;
• the impact of our efforts to continue to advance sustainable and socially conscious business operations, and to meet the expectations that our
investors and other stakeholders have with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices;
• the effects of climate change, natural disasters, and the impacts of public health issues, and the related changes in the regulatory environment
and consumer demand to mitigate these effects, and the resulting impact on our business and the businesses of our customers, consumers,
suppliers, and business partners;
• expansion of our brands, product offerings, and investments in our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) capabilities, including our distribution facilities,
e-commerce websites, and our retail store footprint;
• our plans to sell the Sanuk brand and certain related assets, and the sale agreement terms and timing;
• global geopolitical tensions, including the impact of economic sanctions on our transportation and energy costs;
• security breach or other disruption to our information technology (IT) systems, or those of our vendors;
• our interpretation of applicable global tax regulations and changes in tax laws and audits that may impact our tax liability and effective tax
rates;
• our cash repatriation strategy regarding earnings of non-United States (US) subsidiaries and the resulting tax impacts;
• the outcomes of legal proceedings, including the impact they may have on our business and intellectual property rights; and
• the value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and potential write-downs or impairment charges.
Forward-looking statements represent management’s current expectations and predictions about trends affecting our business and industry and are based
on information available at the time such statements are made. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable
basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. Forward-looking statements involve numerous known and unknown risks,
uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance
or achievements predicted, assumed, or implied by the forward-looking statements. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to
materially differ from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements are described in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Part I, Item 2,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Quarterly Report, as well as in our other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which are available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our website at ir.deckers.com. You
should read this Quarterly Report, including the information and documents incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety and with the understanding that our
actual future results may be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Moreover, new risks and uncertainties
emerge occasionally, and it is not possible for management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or
the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause our actual future results to be materially different from any results expressed or implied by
any forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law or the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange, we expressly disclaim any intent or
obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We qualify all our forward-looking statements with these cautionary statements.

DECKERS OUTDOOR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024, and 2023
(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share or share data)
NOTE 1. GENERAL
The Company. Deckers Outdoor Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) is a global leader in designing,
marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high-performance
activities. The Company’s six proprietary brands include the UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk, Koolaburra, and AHNU brands.
The Company sells its products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to its global
consumers through its DTC business, which is comprised of its e-commerce business and retail stores. Independent third-party contractors
manufacture all of the Company’s products.
Seasonality. A significant part of the UGG brand’s business has historically been seasonal, requiring the Company to build inventory levels
during certain quarters in its fiscal year to support higher selling seasons, which has contributed to variation in its results from quarter to quarter.
However, as the Company continues to take steps to diversify and expand its product offerings by creating more year-round styles, and as net
sales of the HOKA brand, which generally occur more evenly throughout the year, continue to increase as a percentage of the Company’s
aggregate net sales, the Company expects to continue to see the impact from seasonality decrease over time.
Basis of Presentation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto (referred to herein
as condensed consolidated financial statements) as of June 30, 2024, and for the three months ended June 30, 2024 (the current period), and
2023 (the prior period) are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US (US GAAP) for interim financial
information pursuant to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X issued by the SEC. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include all the information and disclosures required by US GAAP for annual financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024, is derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements. In the
opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring entries necessary to fairly present the
results of the interim periods presented but are not necessarily indicative of actual results to be achieved for full fiscal years or other interim
periods. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (prior fiscal year),
which was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2024 (2024 Annual Report).
Consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon
historical experience, existing and known circumstances, authoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes
to be reasonable. In addition, the Company has considered the potential impact of macroeconomic factors, including inflation, foreign currency
exchange rate volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in commodity pricing, changes in discretionary spending and recessionary concerns,
on its business and operations. Although the full impact of these factors is unknown, the Company believes it has made appropriate accounting
estimates and assumptions based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. However, actual results could differ
materially from these estimates and assumptions, which may result in material effects on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations, and liquidity. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company’s condensed consolidated
financial statements may be materially affected.

DECKERS OUTDOOR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024, and 2023
(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share or share data)
Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to inventory write-downs; trade accounts receivable
allowances, including variable consideration for net sales provided to customers, such as the sales return asset and liability; contract assets and
liabilities; stock-based compensation; impairment assessments, including goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets; depreciation
and amortization; income tax receivables and liabilities; uncertain tax positions; the fair value of financial instruments; the reasonably certain
lease term; lease classification; and the Company’s incremental borrowing rate utilized to measure its operating lease assets and lease
liabilities.
Foreign Currency Translation. The Company considers the US dollar as its functional currency. The Company’s wholly owned foreign
subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily cash, receivables, and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than its
functional currency. The Company remeasures these monetary assets and liabilities using the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period,
which results in gains and losses that are recorded in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the condensed consolidated
statements of comprehensive income as incurred. In addition, the Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with reporting
currencies other than US dollars into US dollars using the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period, which results in financial statement
translation gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI) in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive
income.
Reportable Operating Segments. The Company’s six reportable operating segments include the worldwide wholesale operations of the
UGG brand, HOKA brand, Teva brand, Sanuk brand, and Other brands (primarily consisting of the Koolaburra and AHNU brands), as well as
DTC (collectively, the Company’s reportable operating segments). Refer to Note 9, “Reportable Operating Segments,” for further information on
the Company’s reportable operating segments as well as Note 12, “Subsequent Events,” for an update on the Company’s sale of the Sanuk
brand and certain related assets.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) that
have been adopted and not yet adopted by the Company as stated below.

The fair value of Designated Derivative Contracts is determined using quoted forward spot rates at the end of the applicable reporting
period from counterparties, which are corroborated by market-based pricing (Level 2), with related assets and liabilities recorded in other current
assets and other accrued expenses, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 6, “Derivative Instruments,” for
further information, including the definition of the term Designated Derivative Contracts.
NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense and the effective income tax rate were as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30,
2024 2023
Income tax expense $ 33,528 $ 17,812
Effective income tax rate 22.5 % 21.9 %
The tax provisions during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, were computed using the estimated effective income tax rate
applicable to each of the domestic and foreign taxable jurisdictions for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, respectively,
and were adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented above. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the net
increase in the effective income tax rate, compared to the prior period, was due to higher operating income, including changes in jurisdictional
mix of worldwide income before income taxes, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits for stock-based compensation.

Recent Tax Law Changes. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (commonly known as OECD) has released Pillar
Two model rules introducing a 15% global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations to be effective starting with tax periods ending in
2024. Various jurisdictions the Company operates in have enacted or plan to enact legislation beginning in calendar year 2024 or in subsequent
years. The enactment of Pillar Two legislation did not have a material effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of
comprehensive income during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The Company will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such
legislative changes in future periods, as each of the respective jurisdictions enact the legislation and the legislation becomes effective.
NOTE 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases. The Company primarily leases retail stores, showrooms, offices, and distribution facilities under operating lease contracts. There
were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business during the three months ended June 30, 2024, to the operating lease terms
disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report.
Supplemental information for amounts presented in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows related to operating leases, were
as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30,
2024 2023
Non-cash operating activities
Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities (1) $ 12,336 $ 21,587
Reductions to operating lease assets for reductions to lease liabilities (1) (1,106) (65)
(1) Amounts disclosed include non-cash additions or reductions resulting from lease remeasurements, as well as reductions for tenant improvement
allowances.
Operating lease liabilities recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets exclude an aggregate of $15,289 of undiscounted
minimum lease payments due pursuant to leases signed but not yet commenced during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and through
July 11, 2024, primarily for a new HOKA brand retail store lease in Paris that will be operational during the quarter ending December 31, 2024.
Purchase Obligations. There were no material changes to purchase obligations last disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report outside the
ordinary course of business during the three months ended June 30, 2024.
Litigation. From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings, disputes, and other claims arising in the ordinary
course of business, including employment, intellectual property, and product liability claims. Although the results of these matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, the Company believes it is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, disputes, or other claims for which a material
loss is considered probable and for which the amount (or range) of loss is reasonably estimable. However, regardless of the merit of the claims
raised or the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management’s time
and resources, and other factors.
Refer to Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in Part IV of the 2024 Annual
Report for further information on the Company’s contractual obligations and commitments.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company enters into foreign currency forward or option contracts (derivative contracts) with maturities of 15 months or less to manage
foreign currency risk and certain of these derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales (Designated Derivative
Contracts).
The after-tax unrealized gains or losses from changes in fair value of Designated Derivative Contracts are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are reclassified to net sales in the
condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the same period or periods as the related sales are recognized. When it is
probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and the accumulated gains or losses in AOCL
related to the hedging relationship are immediately recorded in OCI in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Refer
to Note 1, “General,” in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in Part IV of the 2024 Annual Report for further information regarding
the Company’s derivative instruments accounting policy.
As of June 30, 2024, the Company has the following Designated Derivative Contracts recorded at fair value in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets:
Notional value $ 158,842
Fair value recorded in other current assets 1,399
Fair value recorded in other accrued expenses (267)
As of June 30, 2024, four counterparties hold the Company’s outstanding derivative contracts, all of which are expected to mature in the
next nine months. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding derivative contracts.
The following table summarizes the effect of Designated Derivative Contracts and the related income tax effects of unrealized gains or
losses recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for changes in AOCL:
Three Months Ended June 30,
2024 2023
Gain recorded in OCI $ 1,132 $ 411
Reclassifications from AOCL into net sales — 21
Income tax expense in OCI (276) (80)
Total $ 856 $ 352
The non-performance risk of the Company and its counterparties did not have a material impact on the fair value of its derivative contracts.
As of June 30, 2024, the amount of unrealized gains on derivative contracts recorded in AOCL is expected to be reclassified into net sales within
the next nine months. Refer to Note 7, “Stockholders’ Equity,” for further information on the components of AOCL.
NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Stock Repurchase Program. The Company’s Board of Directors (Board) has approved various authorizations under the Company’s stock
repurchase program to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market
conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors (collectively, the stock repurchase program). As of June 30, 2024, the aggregate
remaining approved amount under the stock repurchase program is $789,737. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to
acquire any amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion.

NOTE 8. BASIC AND DILUTED SHARES
The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding was as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30,
2024 2023
Basic 25,478,000 26,165,000
Dilutive effect of equity awards 103,000 156,000
Diluted 25,581,000 26,321,000
Excluded
Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 48,000 76,000
Employee Stock Purchase Plan — 1,000
Excluded Awards. The equity awards excluded from the calculation of the dilutive effect have been excluded due to one of the following:
(1) the shares were antidilutive; (2) the necessary conditions had not been satisfied for the shares to be deemed issuable based on the
Company’s performance for the relevant performance period; or (3) the Company recorded a net loss during the period presented (such that
inclusion of these equity awards in the calculation would have been antidilutive). The number of shares stated for each of these excluded awards
is the maximum number of shares issuable pursuant to these awards. For those awards subject to the achievement of performance criteria, the
actual number of shares to be issued pursuant to such awards will be based on Company performance in future periods, net of forfeitures, and
may be materially lower than the number of shares presented, which could result in a lower dilutive effect. Refer to Note 8, “Stock-Based
Compensation,” in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in Part IV of the 2024 Annual Report for further information on the
Company’s equity incentive plans.

NOTE 9. REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS
Information reported to the CODM, who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), President, and Principal Executive Officer (PEO),
is organized into the Company’s six reportable operating segments and is consistent with how the CODM evaluates performance and allocates
resources. The Company does not consider international operations to be a separate reportable operating segment, and the CODM reviews
such operations in the aggregate with the reportable operating segments.
Segment Net Sales and Income from Operations. The Company evaluates reportable operating segment performance primarily based
on net sales and income (loss) from operations. The wholesale operations of each brand are managed separately because each requires
different marketing, research and development, design, sourcing, and sales strategies. The income (loss) from operations of each of the
reportable operating segments includes only those costs which are specifically related to each reportable operating segment, which consist
primarily of cost of sales, research and development, design, sales and marketing, depreciation, amortization, and the direct costs of employees
within those reportable operating segments.
The Company does not allocate corporate overhead costs or non-operating income and expenses to reportable operating segments, which
include unallocable overhead costs associated with the Company’s warehouses and DCs, certain executive and stock-based compensation,
accounting, finance, legal, IT, human resources, and facilities, among others. Inter-segment sales from the Company’s wholesale reportable
operating segments to the DTC reportable operating segment are at the Company’s cost, and there is no inter-segment profit on these inter-
segment sales, nor are they reflected in income (loss) from operations of the wholesale reportable operating segments as these transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.
Reportable operating segment information, with a reconciliation to the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, was
as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30,

equipment, net, operating lease assets, goodwill, other intangible assets, net, and certain other assets that are specifically identifiable for one of
the Company’s reportable operating segments. Unallocated assets are those assets not directly related to a specific reportable operating

The Company has two customers that represent 23.5% and 31.2% of trade accounts receivable, net, as of June 30, 2024, and March 31,
2024, respectively. Management performs regular evaluations concerning the ability of the Company’s customers to satisfy their obligations to
the Company and recognizes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on these evaluations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company maintains a portion of its cash in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured bank deposit
accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Based
on the size and strength of the banking institutions used, the Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risks in cash.

NOTE 11. SUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAM
Supplier Finance Program. The Company has a voluntary SFP administered through a third-party platform that provides the Company’s
independent manufacturers that supply its inventory (inventory suppliers) the opportunity to sell their receivables due from the Company to
participating financial institutions in advance of the invoice due date, at the sole discretion of both inventory suppliers and the financial
institutions. The Company is not party to the agreements between these third parties and has no economic interest in an inventory suppliers’
decision to sell a receivable.
The Company’s payment obligations, including the amounts due and payment terms, which generally do not exceed 90 days, are not
impacted by the inventory suppliers’ election to participate in the SFP, and the Company provides no guarantees to any third parties under the
SFP. Accordingly, amounts due to inventory suppliers that elected to participate in the SFP are presented in trade accounts payable in the
condensed consolidated balance sheets.
As of June 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, the Company had $8,571 and $3,483, respectively, of balances outstanding related to the SFP
recorded in trade accounts payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Payments made in connection with the SFP are reported as

REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENT OVERVIEW
Our six reportable operating segments include the worldwide wholesale operations of the UGG brand, HOKA brand, Teva brand, Sanuk
brand, and Other brands, as well as DTC. Information reported to the CODM, who is our CEO, President, and PEO, is organized into these
reportable operating segments and is consistent with how the CODM evaluates our performance and allocates resources.
UGG Brand. The UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized footwear brands in our industry, which highlights our successful
track record of building niche brands into lifestyle and fashion market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has
proven to be a highly resilient line of premium footwear, apparel, and accessories with expanded product offerings that appeal to a growing
global audience and a broad demographic.
HOKA Brand. The HOKA brand is an authentic premium line of year-round performance footwear, which offers enhanced cushioning and
inherent stability with minimal weight. Originally designed for ultra-runners, the brand now appeals to world champions, taste makers, and
everyday athletes. Expanded marketing and strategic marketplace presence have fueled both domestic and international sales growth of the
HOKA brand, which has quickly become a leading brand within run and outdoor specialty wholesale accounts and is growing across its
ecosystem of access points. The HOKA brand’s product line includes running, trail, hiking, fitness, and lifestyle footwear offerings, as well as
select apparel and accessories.
Teva Brand. The Teva brand, born in the depths of the Grand Canyon, has long been a favored brand among outdoor adventurers across
the globe. Today, building on its foundation as a leader in sport sandals and its authentic outdoor heritage, the Teva brand’s thoughtfully
designed, and accessible products are built for a range of outdoor pursuits, connecting with a vibrant, diverse audience passionate about
exploration. The Teva brand’s collection includes a variety of footwear options, from classic sandals and shoes to boots; all crafted for the
demands of the outdoors.
Sanuk Brand. The Sanuk brand originated in Southern California surf culture and has emerged as a lifestyle brand with a presence in the
relaxed casual shoe and sandal categories with a focus on innovation in comfort and sustainability. The Sanuk brand’s use of unexpected
materials and unconventional construction, combined with its fun and playful branding, are key elements of the brand’s identity.

Other Brands. Other brands consist primarily of the Koolaburra, as well as the recently launched AHNU brand. The Koolaburra brand is a
casual footwear fashion line that uses plush materials and is intended to target the value-oriented consumer in order to complement the UGG
brand offering. The AHNU brand’s footwear products fuse high-performance technology with timeless style crafted for everyday wear.
Refer to the “Reportable Operating Segment Overview,” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations,” of our 2024 Annual Report for further discussion of our outlook on consumer demand drivers for our UGG, HOKA,
Teva, Sanuk, and Other brands products.
Direct-to-Consumer. Our DTC business encompasses all of our brands and is comprised of our e-commerce websites and retail stores,
which are intertwined and interdependent in an omni-channel marketplace. Net sales from our e-commerce websites and retail stores are
recorded in our DTC reportable operating segment, except for net sales from our partner retail stores, which are recorded in our brands’
respective wholesale reportable operating segments.
During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we opened nine new stores, which included six HOKA brand stores and three UGG brand
stores, including a HOKA brand flagship store in New York City and a UGG brand flagship store in London, UK, respectively. As of June 30,
2024, we have a total of 172 global retail stores (including 32 HOKA brand retail stores and 140 UGG brand retail stores), which includes 89
concept stores and 83 outlet stores.
Refer to the “Reportable Operating Segment Overview” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations,” of our 2024 Annual Report for further details on our DTC reportable operating segment, including retail store
definitions.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We disclose financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP; however, throughout this Quarterly Report we
provide certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis (non-GAAP financial measures). We provide non-GAAP financial measures to provide
information that may assist investors in understanding our results of operations and assessing our prospects for future performance, which
consist of constant currency measures. We believe evaluating certain financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis is
important as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not indicative of our core results of operations and are
largely outside of our control. However, our non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent and should not be considered more
meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of financial or operating performance as determined in accordance with US GAAP.
We calculate our constant currency non-GAAP financial measures for current period financial information, such as total net sales using the
foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period, excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange
rate hedges and remeasurements in the condensed consolidated financial statements. We also report comparable DTC sales on a constant
currency basis for DTC operations that were open throughout the current and prior reporting periods, and we may adjust prior reporting periods
to conform to current year accounting policies. The information presented on a constant currency basis, as we present such information, may not
necessarily be comparable to similarly titled information presented by other companies, and may not be appropriate measures for comparing our
performance relative to other companies. Constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation as an alternative to US dollar
measures that reflect current period foreign currency exchange rates or to other financial or operating measures presented in accordance with
US GAAP.

Total $ 825,347 $ 675,791 $ 149,556 22.1 %
Total net sales increased primarily due to higher global wholesale and DTC channel sales for the HOKA brand, as well as higher domestic
wholesale and global DTC channel sales for the UGG brand.
On a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 23.0%, compared to the prior period. Further, we experienced an increase of 13.4% in
the total volume of units sold to 12,700 from 11,200, compared to the prior period. Units sold represents all units related to the total net sales
presented, inclusive of all categories such as footwear, apparel, accessories, home goods, and care kits. The prior period total volume of units
sold for only footwear has been modified to conform to the current period presentation.
Drivers of significant changes in net sales, compared to the prior period, were as follows:
• Wholesale net sales of the HOKA brand increased due to higher global sales across the brand’s product assortment, driven by
market share gains, refilling channel inventory, and benefits from select new points of distribution with key partners.
• DTC net sales increased primarily due to higher global sales for the HOKA and UGG brands, driven primarily by consumer
acquisition and retention online as we continued to experience increased demand for both brands, as well as benefiting from a
higher level of full-price selling, primarily for the UGG brand. Comparable DTC channel net sales for the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2024, increased by 21.9%, compared to the prior period.
• Wholesale net sales of the UGG brand increased primarily due to higher domestic sales, resulting from strong brand heat driving
earlier demand and refilling of inventory levels for our partners, including adoption of year-round key product franchises.
• International net sales, which are included in the reportable operating segment net sales presented above, increased by 20.8%
and represented 37.5% and 37.9% of total net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These
changes were primarily driven by higher net sales for both channels of the HOKA brand, primarily in Europe and China.
Gross Profit. Gross margin increased to 56.9% from 51.3%, compared to the prior period, primarily due to favorable brand mix for the
HOKA brand along with higher margin product driving a higher proportion of growth for both the HOKA and UGG brands, higher full-price selling,
particularly for the UGG brand that was more promotional in the prior period, and favorable changes in freight costs.
24
Table of Contents
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. The net increase in SG&A expenses, compared to the prior period, was primarily the result
of the following:
• Increased payroll and related costs of approximately $24,900, primarily due to investments in talent for key functions for
corporate and HOKA brand roles driving higher employee headcount and full-year costs for prior comparable period hiring.
• Increased variable advertising and promotion expenses of approximately $15,800, primarily due to higher promotional marketing
expenses for the HOKA brand to drive global brand awareness and market share gains, highlight new product categories, and
provide localized marketing.
• Increased other variable net selling expenses of approximately $8,800, primarily due to higher rent and occupancy, materials
and supplies, credit card fees, and warehouse expenses.
• Increased other operating expenses of approximately $7,600, primarily due to higher infrastructure investments and related
depreciation, and higher travel expenses, partially offset by lower legal expenses.
• Increased net foreign currency-related losses of approximately $4,400, primarily driven by unfavorable changes in Asian and
Canadian exchange rates against the US dollar.
Income from Operations. Income (loss) from operations by reportable operating segment was as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30,
2024 2023 Change
Amount Amount Amount %
Income (loss) from operations
UGG brand wholesale $ 38,430 $ 16,866 $ 21,564 127.9 %
HOKA brand wholesale 124,694 86,524 38,170 44.1
Teva brand wholesale 6,789 9,237 (2,448) (26.5)

Total $ 132,807 $ 70,736 $ 62,071 87.8 %
The increase in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins,
combined with relatively flat SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.
Drivers of significant net changes in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, were as follows:
• The increase in income from operations of HOKA brand wholesale was due to higher global net sales at higher gross margins,
as well as slightly lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.
• The increase in income from operations of the DTC channel was due to higher global net sales for the HOKA and UGG brands
at higher gross margins, as well as slightly lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in total.
• The increase in income from operations of UGG brand wholesale was primarily due to higher domestic net sales at higher gross
margins, as well as lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.
• The increase in unallocated overhead costs was higher as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to higher payroll costs for
key corporate roles to support growth of our brands, increased foreign currency-related losses, and higher other operating
expenses.
25
Table of Contents
Total Other Income, Net. The increase in total other income, net, compared to the prior period, was due to higher interest income from
higher average invested cash balances and average interest rates.
Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense and our effective income tax rate were as follows:
Three Months Ended June 30,
2024 2023
Income tax expense $ 33,528 $ 17,812
Effective income tax rate 22.5 % 21.9 %
The net increase in our effective income tax rate, compared to the prior period, was due to higher operating income, including changes in
jurisdictional mix of worldwide income before income taxes, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits for stock-based compensation.
Net Income. The increase in net income, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales and operating margins, as well
as higher interest income. Net income per share increased, compared to the prior period, due to higher net income and lower weighted-average
common shares outstanding driven by stock repurchases.
Total Other Comprehensive Loss, Net of Tax. The decrease in total other comprehensive loss, net of tax, compared to the prior period, was
primarily due to lower foreign currency translation losses relating to changes in the net asset position against Asian foreign currency exchange
rates.
LIQUIDITY
Our liquidity may be impacted by a number of factors, risks and uncertainties described in the section titled “Liquidity” in Part II, Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our
2024 Annual Report.
Sources of Liquidity. We finance our working capital and operating requirements using a combination of cash and cash equivalents
balances, including cash from our repatriation strategy, cash provided from ongoing operating activities and, to a lesser extent, available
borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Refer to the “Cash Flows” section below for further discussion on cash flows from
ongoing operating activities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. As of June 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents are $1,438,397, the majority of which is held in highly
rated money market funds and interest-bearing bank deposit accounts with established national and global financial institutions. We believe our
cash and cash equivalents balances, cash provided by operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities,
will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our working capital requirements and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months
and will be sufficient to meet the long-term requirements of our business strategies and plans. However, there can be no assurance that
sufficient capital will continue to be available or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us.
Repatriation of Cash. Our cash repatriation strategy, and by extension, our liquidity, may be impacted by several additional considerations,
which include future changes to or interpretations of global tax law and regulations, and our actual earnings in future periods. During the three
months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, no cash and cash equivalents were repatriated. As of June 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, we have
$343,082 and $263,820, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries, a portion of which may be subject to additional
foreign withholding taxes if it were to be repatriated. We continue to evaluate our cash repatriation strategy and currently anticipate repatriating
current and future unremitted earnings of non-US subsidiaries to the extent they have been subject to US income tax if such cash is not required
to fund ongoing foreign operations. Refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our 2024 Annual
Report for further information regarding our cash repatriation strategy.

Revolving Credit Facilities. Information about the revolving credit facilities available as of June 30, 2024, is as follows:
• Primary Credit Facility. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we made no borrowings or repayments and there were
no material changes to the terms, to the outstanding letters of credit, or to the borrowing availability under our unsecured
revolving credit facility disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report.
• China Credit Facility. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we made no borrowings or repayments and there were no
material changes to the terms or to the outstanding bank guarantees under our credit facility in China disclosed in our 2024
Annual Report.
• Debt Covenants. As of June 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities.
Refer to Note 6, “Revolving Credit Facilities,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our 2024 Annual Report for further
information on the terms of our revolving credit facilities.
Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include uses for working capital, and payments to fulfill contractual
obligations, capital expenditures, and stock repurchases. Our working capital requirements begin when we purchase raw and other materials
and inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting trade accounts receivable. Given the historical seasonality of our business,
our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout our fiscal year, and we utilize available cash to build inventory levels during
certain quarters in our fiscal year to support higher selling seasons. While the impact of seasonality has been mitigated to some extent, we
expect our working capital requirements will continue to fluctuate from period to period.
Contractual Obligations. Refer to the subsection titled “Leases” under Note 5, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of our condensed
consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report for further information regarding our material contractual
obligations incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and through July 11, 2024.
Except for the above, there were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations or capital
expenditures disclosed in the sections titled “Contractual Obligations” and “Capital Expenditures” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our 2024 Annual Report.
Stock Repurchase Program. As of June 30, 2024, the aggregate remaining approved amount under our stock repurchase program is
$789,737. Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock and suspend at any time at our
discretion.
Refer to Note 7, “Stockholders’ Equity,” of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 and to Part II, Item 2,
“Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds,” within this Quarterly Report for further information regarding our stock
repurchase program and capital allocation strategy.

CASH FLOWS
The following table summarizes the major components of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented:
Three Months Ended June 30,
2024 2023 Change
Amount Amount Amount %
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 112,650 $ 125,262 $ (12,612) (10.1)%
Net cash used in investing activities (22,521) (30,732) 8,211 26.7
Net cash used in financing activities (151,861) (25,619) (126,242) (492.8)
Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and
cash equivalents (1,922) (3,817) 1,895 49.6
Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (63,654) $ 65,094 $ (128,748) (197.8)%
Operating Activities. Our primary source of liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities, which is driven by our net income after
non-cash adjustments and changes in working capital.
The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the prior period, was
due to $70,111 of unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by $57,499 of favorable net income after non-cash
adjustments. The unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to increased purchases of inventory to support
higher demand for our brands, increased accrual primarily for performance-based compensation related to the prior fiscal year, increased trade
accounts receivable on higher net sales, partially offset by favorable changes due to timing of derivative cash settlements, tax refunds and
payments, as well as receipt of goods and services relative to payments on trade accounts payable.
Investing Activities. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the
prior period, was primarily due to lower capital expenditures for leasehold improvements for our warehouses and DCs.
Financing Activities. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the
prior period, was primarily due to a higher dollar value of stock repurchases.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing
and known circumstances, authoritative accounting pronouncements, and other factors that we believe to be reasonable, but actual results could
differ materially from these estimates. In addition, management has considered the potential impact of macroeconomic factors, including
inflation, foreign currency exchange rate volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in commodity pricing, changes in consumer discretionary
spending, and recessionary concerns, on our business and operations. Although the full impact of these factors is unknown, management
believes it has made appropriate accounting estimates and assumptions based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting
date. However, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions, which may result in material effects on our financial
condition, results of operations and liquidity. Refer to the sections titled “Use of Estimates” and “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” within Note
1, “General,” of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report, for additional information
regarding applicable key estimates and assumptions, as well as the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.
There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and key estimates and assumptions disclosed in the section titled
“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” within our 2024 Annual Report.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business, our financial position and results of operations are subject to a variety of risks, including risks associated
with commodity pricing, foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, interest rates. We regularly assess these risks and have
established policies and business practices designed to mitigate their effects. There have been no material changes in the quantitative and
qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” within our
2024 Annual Report.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, which are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. In designing and evaluating our disclosure
controls and procedures, our management recognized that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours is designed to do, and management necessarily is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any
system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-
effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our PEO and Principal Financial and
Accounting Officer (PFAO) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of June 30,
2024.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15(d) of
the Exchange Act during the three months ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER CERTIFICATIONS
The certifications of our PEO and PFAO required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Exchange Act are filed as Exhibit 31.1 and Exhibit 31.2, and
furnished as Exhibit 32, to this Quarterly Report. This Part I, Item 4, should be read in conjunction with such certifications for a more complete
understanding of the topics presented.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
As part of our global policing program to protect our intellectual property rights, from time to time, we file lawsuits in various jurisdictions
asserting claims for alleged acts of trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, patent infringement, trade dress infringement, and
trademark dilution. We generally have multiple actions such as these pending at any given point in time. These actions may result in seizure of
counterfeit merchandise, out-of-court settlements with defendants, or other outcomes. In addition, from time to time, we are subject to claims in
which opposing parties will raise, either as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims, the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of our intellectual
property rights, including allegations that the UGG brand trademark registrations and design patents are invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore,
we are aware of many instances throughout the world in which a third-party is using our UGG brand and HOKA brand trademarks within its
internet domain name. We are investigating several manufacturers and distributors of counterfeit UGG and HOKA brand products, as well as
various markets for indications of counterfeit UGG and HOKA brand products.
From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings, disputes, and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business,
including employment, intellectual property, and product liability claims. Although the results of these ordinary course matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, regardless of the merit of the
claims raised or the outcome, these ordinary course matters can have an adverse impact on us as a result of legal costs, diversion of
management’s time and resources, and other factors.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock involves risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all the information
within Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as in our condensed
consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report. In addition, you should carefully
consider the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our 2024 Annual Report, as well as in our other public filings
with the SEC. If any of the identified risks are realized, our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and prospects could be
materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you could lose all or part of your
investment. In addition, other risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we do not currently view to be material, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and prospects.
During the three months ended June 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A,
“Risk Factors,” of our 2024 Annual Report.

Our Board of Directors (Board) has approved various authorizations under our stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our
common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other
factors (collectively, the stock repurchase program). Our Board last approved an additional authorization of $1,200,000 on July 27, 2022, to
repurchase our common stock under the same conditions as the prior stock repurchase programs. As of June 30, 2024, the aggregate remaining
approved amount under the stock repurchase program is $789,737.
Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at our
discretion. The agreements under our revolving credit facilities allow us to make stock repurchases under this program, so long as we do not
exceed certain leverage ratios. As of June 30, 2024, we have not exceeded the stated leverage ratios and no defaults have occurred under our
credit agreements.
Stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program during the three months ended June 30, 2024, was as follows:
Dollar value of shares
Total number of Average price per Dollar value of shares remaining for
shares repurchased (1) share paid repurchased (2) (3) repurchase (3)

(1) All share repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program in open-market transactions.
(2) The dollar value of shares repurchased excludes the cost of broker commissions, excise taxes, and other costs.
(3) May not calculate on rounded dollars.
Subsequent to June 30, 2024, through July 11, 2024, we repurchased 17,307 shares at an average price of $924.11 per share for $15,994,
and had $773,743 remaining authorized under our stock repurchase program.

9
(p) “Retirement” will mean normal retirement at age 65.
(q) “Section 409A Safe Harbor Limit” will mean, as determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation
§1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), an amount equal to two (2) times the lesser of (i) Executive’s annual rate of compensation for the taxable year
immediately preceding the taxable year in which Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company, or (ii) the dollar amount in effect
under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the taxable year in which Executive’s employment is terminated.
(r) “Severance” will mean payments after termination of Executive’s employment.
(s) “Total Disability” will mean the Executive’s failure substantially to perform the Executive’s duties
hereunder on a full-time basis for a period exceeding one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or for periods aggregating more than one
hundred eighty (180) days during any twelve (12) month period as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness. If there is a
dispute as to whether the Executive is or was physically or mentally unable to perform the Executive’s duties under this Agreement, such
dispute will be submitted for resolution to a licensed physician agreed upon by the Company and the Executive, or if an agreement cannot
be promptly reached, the Company and the Executive will promptly each select a physician, and if these physicians cannot agree, the
physicians will promptly select a third physician whose decision will be binding on all parties. If such a dispute arises, the Executive will
submit to such examinations and will provide such information as such physician(s) may request, and the determination of the physician(s)
as to the Executive’s physical or mental condition will be binding and conclusive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive
participates in any group disability plan provided by the Company, which offers long-term disability benefits, “Total Disability” will mean
total disability as defined therein.
6.2 KEY MAN INSURANCE. The Company will have the right, in its sole discretion, to purchase “key man”
insurance on the life of the Executive. The Company shall be the owner and beneficiary of any such policy. If the Company elects to
purchase such a policy, the Executive will take such physical examinations and supply such information as may be reasonably requested
by the insurer.
6.3 PARACHUTE PAYMENTS. If any payment or benefit due under this Agreement, together with all other payments
and benefits (including, without limitation, the acceleration of vesting of stock options, restricted stock and performance shares) to which
the Executive is entitled from the Company, or any affiliate thereof, would (if paid or provided) constitute an “excess parachute payment”
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, or any successor provision), the amounts otherwise payable and benefits otherwise due
under this Agreement will either (a) be delivered in full, or (b) be limited to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion
thereof will fail to be tax-deductible to the Company by reason of Section 280G of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking
into account the applicable federal, state or local income and employment taxes and the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the
Code, results in the Executive’s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion
of such benefits may be subject to the excise tax imposed
10
under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that the payments and/or benefits are to be reduced pursuant to this Section 6.3, such
payments and benefits shall be reduced such that the reduction of compensation to be provided to Executive as a result of this Section 6.3
is minimized. In applying this principle, the reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code and where two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such amounts shall be
reduced on a pro-rata basis but not below zero.
6.4 SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT. This Agreement will be binding upon any successor to the Company
and will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive’s personal or legal representatives, beneficiaries, designees, executors,
administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
6.5 MODIFICATION; NO WAIVER. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto. No term or condition of this Agreement will be deemed to have been waived, nor will there be any
estoppel against the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement, except by written instrument by the party charged with such waiver
or estoppel. No such written waiver will be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated therein, and each such waiver will
operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and will not constitute a waiver of such term or condition for the future or as to
any other term or condition.
6.6 SEVERABILITY. The covenants and agreements contained herein are separate and severable and the invalidity or
unenforceability of any one or more of such covenants or agreements, if not material to the employment arrangement that is the basis for
this Agreement, will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other covenant or agreement contained herein.
6.7 FORM OF NOTICE TO PARTIES. All notices, requests, demands, waivers and other communications required or
permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if (a) delivered personally, (b)
mailed by first-class, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (c) sent by next-day or overnight mail or

written consent of the other party except as otherwise specifically provided for herein.
6.9 ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties hereto and
no agreement, representation, warranty or covenant has been made by either party except as expressly set forth herein, and supersedes any
change of control and severance agreement entered into by Company and Executive.
6.10 EXECUTIVE’S REPRESENTATIONS. The Executive represents and warrants that neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the performance of the Executive’s duties hereunder violates the provisions of any other agreement to
which he is a party or by which he is bound.
6.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof, with venue proper only in the County of Santa Barbara, California.

settled by binding arbitration, to be held in Santa Barbara, California under the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures

(i) administrative claims properly presented to an administrative agency, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
or federal Department of Labor (Wage and Hour Division), or any equivalent state administrative agency, except that if any such claim is
dismissed from the administrative agency's jurisdiction, the parties must then submit to binding arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, and
except that Executive may (but is not required to) choose arbitration to resolve Executive’s dispute rather than pursuing a claim with an
administrative agency; (ii) claims for workers’ compensation benefits; (iii) claims for unemployment compensation benefits; (iv) claims

arbitrator will have the authority to award any remedy or relief that would have been available to Executive or the Company had the
matter been heard in court, including an award of attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party to the extent such an award is authorized
by applicable law.
(e) The arbitrator(s) shall apply California law to the merits of any dispute or claim, without reference to rules
of conflicts of law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall provide the reasons for the arbitrator's award unless the
Parties otherwise agree in writing.

Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1, et. seq.
(g) The Company shall pay all of the costs of arbitration, including the arbitrator’s fees, except Executive shall
pay the fees that s/he would normally have to pay in order to bring a lawsuit in a court of law.
13
(h) Executive agrees that in any arbitration between Executive and the Company, Executive will assert only
his/her own individual claims, and will not assert any claims on behalf of any other person or class of persons. Executive hereby waive
any rights to bring a class action against the Company, or to participate as a class member in any class action brought by any third party
against the Company.
(i) The parties may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this arbitration agreement and without abridgement of
the powers of the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award will be enforceable in any court having proper jurisdiction.
(j) EXECUTIVE HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THIS SECTION, WHICH DISCUSSES
ARBITRATION. EXECUTIVE UNDERSTANDS THAT BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, EXECUTIVE AGREES TO SUBMIT

EXECUTIVE’S RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND RELATES TO THE RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES RELATING TO HIS/HER
