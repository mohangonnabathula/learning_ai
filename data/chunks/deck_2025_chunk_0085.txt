 each
brand within these reportable operating segments are managed separately because each requires different
marketing, research and development, design, sourcing, and sales strategies.
The Company does not regularly provide total assets or capital expenditures information by reportable
operating segment to the CODM because that information is not used to evaluate performance or allocate
resources to each reportable operating segment.
Segment Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Income from Operations. The CODM regularly evaluates the
performance of each reportable operating segment based on net sales, gross profit as a percentage of net sales
(gross margin), and income from operations when making decisions about resource allocations to each reportable
operating segment. Income from operations of each reportable operating segment includes certain costs which are
specifically related to each reportable operating segment and that are regularly provided to the CODM. These costs
consist of cost of sales; payroll and related expenses, including stock-based compensation; advertising, marketing,
and promotion expenses; rent and occupancy; depreciation and other related costs; and other segment items.

There are no inter-segment sales for any period presented. The accounting policies of the Company's reportable
operating segments are consistent with those described in Note 1, “General.”
Income from operations of each reportable operating segment exclude enterprise and shared brand expenses
as well as total other income, net, which are not used to assess reportable operating segment performance.
Unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses are costs that are managed centrally and not specific to any one
brand. These costs are primarily comprised of certain payroll and related expenses, including stock-based
compensation; global IT expenses; 3PL service fees; depreciation, rent, and occupancy for owned warehouses and
offices; and other SG&A expenses, such as costs for contract services, materials, supplies, and travel. These costs
span multiple functions including owned warehouses and 3PL service fees, along with enterprise costs which
include centralized commercial operations, IT, finance, human resources, legal, supply chain, and corporate
executives.
