(1) Includes Teva and Sanuk brand’s full financial results for the years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, which are
presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment. Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments
Overview,” above for further information on the recent change in our reportable operating segments.
Total net sales increased primarily due to higher global net sales across all channels for the HOKA and UGG
brands, partially offset by lower net sales for Other brands across all channels. Drivers of significant changes in net
sales, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, were as follows:
• Net sales of the HOKA brand increased due to higher demand for an assortment of performance
products across all channels. HOKA brand wholesale channel growth was driven primarily by
market share gains in the US and Asia, partially offset by lower net sales in Europe, primarily
related to the timing of certain distributor shipments. HOKA brand DTC channel growth was driven
primarily by global gains in consumer acquisition and retention online.
• Net sales of the UGG brand increased due to strong global adoption of key product franchises, as
well as benefits from a higher level of full price selling and selective price increases on popular
styles, across all channels.
• Net sales of the Other brands decreased primarily due to lower demand in the wholesale channel
globally for the Teva brand related to pressures on the value-oriented consumer in the sandal
category and shipping timing differences, as well as in the US for the Sanuk brand due to lower
consumer demand and elevated marketplace inventory levels.
Supplemental Disclosure
• On a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 17.9%, compared to the year ended March
31, 2023.
• Comparable DTC channel net sales for the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2024, increased by 25.4%
compared to the year ended March 31, 2023.
• We experienced an increase of 2.8% in the total volume of units sold to 65,300 from 63,500,
compared to the year ended March 31, 2023. Units sold include all categories such as footwear,
apparel, accessories, home goods, and care kits.
Gross Profit. Gross margin increased to 55.6% from 50.3%, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023,
primarily due to favorable full-price selling for the UGG brand, favorable changes in freight costs, favorable HOKA
brand mix and UGG brand product mix shifts, including benefits from selective price increases, and favorable mix of
sales in the DTC channel.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Drivers of significant net changes in SG&A expenses,
compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, were as follows:
• Increased payroll and related costs of approximately $107,500, primarily due to higher headcount
from investments in talent, including for the UGG and HOKA brands as well as enterprise functions,
along with higher variable payroll costs to support higher sales, including performance-based
compensation.
• Increased advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses of approximately $77,700, primarily due
to higher promotional marketing expenses for the HOKA and UGG brands to drive global brand
awareness and market share gains, highlight new product categories, and provide localized
marketing.
• Increased other SG&A expenses of approximately $65,500, primarily due to higher unallocated
enterprise and shared brand expenses of approximately $46,700 for IT expenses for programming
and software costs, 3PL service fees, legal fees, contract services, travel costs, and other operating
expenses, and higher HOKA brand expenses of approximately $14,400 for credit card fees and
travel costs.

• Increased rent and occupancy of approximately $21,400, primarily due to higher rent expenses
resulting from retail store footprint expansion for the HOKA brand, as well as from UGG brand retail
stores and enterprise offices.
• Increased depreciation and other related costs of approximately $16,100, primarily due to higher
unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses for infrastructure investments and related
depreciation, as well as an impairment for Sanuk brand definite-lived intangible assets.
• Decreased net foreign currency-related remeasurement losses of approximately $2,900, primarily
due to favorable changes in Canadian and Asian exchange rates against the US dollar.
