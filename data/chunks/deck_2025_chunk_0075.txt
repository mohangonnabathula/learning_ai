The deferred tax assets are currently expected to be realized between fiscal years 2026 and 2031. Based on
the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the
deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the results of future
operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets. The Company’s deferred
tax valuation allowances are primarily the result of a valuation allowance on tax attributes and foreign losses in
jurisdictions in which the Company expects it will have limited future profitability. The changes to the Company’s
deferred tax valuation allowances are primarily the result of a valuation allowance on domestic tax attributes.
US Taxation of Foreign Earnings. The Company is subject to US taxation of its foreign subsidiary earnings,
which is considered global intangible low-taxed income (commonly known as GILTI), as well as limitations on the
deductions of executive compensation, which are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income for the periods presented above.
The Company currently anticipates repatriating current and future unremitted earnings of non-US subsidiaries,
to the extent they have been and will be subject to US income tax, as long as such cash is not required to fund
ongoing foreign operations. Due to the complexities in the laws of foreign jurisdictions, it is not practicable to
estimate the amount of foreign withholding taxes associated with such unremitted earnings. No intercompany
dividends were declared by the Company from a foreign subsidiary with related foreign withholding tax requirements
during the year ended March 31, 2025.
As of March 31, 2025, the Company has $16,346 of undistributed earnings and $481,836 of cash and cash
equivalents from its non-US subsidiaries, a portion of which may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes if
it were to be repatriated. As of March 31, 2025, the Company has $1,839 of accumulated deficit from its non-US
subsidiaries for which no US federal or state income taxes have been paid.
