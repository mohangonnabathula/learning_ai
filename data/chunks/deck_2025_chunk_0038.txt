We believe demand for HOKA brand products will continue to be driven by the following:
• Leading performance product innovation, category extensions, and key franchise management,
including higher frequency product drop rates and improving accessibility to all athletes.
• Increased global brand awareness and new consumer adoption through enhanced global marketing
activations and online consumer acquisition, including building a more diverse outdoor community
through digital and in-person event sponsorship.
• Thoughtful and strategic distribution choices, allowing the HOKA brand access and introduction to a
broader, more diverse, consumer base.
• Category extensions in authentic performance footwear offerings such as lifestyle, trail, and fitness
categories.
Other Brands. Other brands consist primarily of the Teva brand, AHNU brand, and Koolaburra brand. The
Teva brand’s products are built for a range of outdoor pursuits and include a variety of footwear options, from classic
sandals and shoes to boots. The AHNU brand’s footwear products fuse high-performance technology with timeless
style crafted for everyday wear. The Koolaburra brand, for which we are phasing out standalone operations by the
end of calendar year 2025, is a casual footwear brand that uses plush materials to target value-oriented consumers.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We disclose supplemental financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (US GAAP); however, throughout this Annual Report we provide certain
financial information on a non-GAAP basis (non-GAAP financial measures). We provide non-GAAP financial
measures to provide information that may assist investors in understanding our results of operations and assessing
our prospects for future performance, which consist of constant currency measures. We believe evaluating certain
financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis is important as it excludes the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not indicative of our core results of operations and are largely outside
of our control. However, our non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent and should not be
considered more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of financial or operating performance as
determined in accordance with US GAAP.
We calculate our constant currency non-GAAP financial measures for current period financial information, such
as total net sales using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable
period, excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate hedges and remeasurements in the consolidated
financial statements. We also report comparable DTC sales on a constant currency basis for DTC operations that
were open throughout the current and prior reporting periods, and we may adjust prior reporting periods to conform
to current year accounting policies. The information presented on a constant currency basis, as we present such
information, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled information presented by other companies, and
may not be appropriate measures for comparing our performance relative to other companies. Constant currency
measures should not be considered in isolation as an alternative to US dollar measures that reflect current period
foreign currency exchange rates or to other financial or operating measures presented in accordance with US
GAAP.
SEASONALITY
A significant part of the UGG brand’s business has historically been seasonal, with the highest percentage of
net sales occurring in the third fiscal quarter, which has contributed to variation in results of operations from quarter
to quarter. However, we have mitigated the impacts of seasonality by diversifying and expanding product offerings
with additional year-round styles. In addition, as the HOKA brand’s net sales, which generally occur more evenly
throughout the fiscal year, continue to increase as a percentage of our aggregate net sales, we expect to reduce the
impacts of seasonality in future periods.
