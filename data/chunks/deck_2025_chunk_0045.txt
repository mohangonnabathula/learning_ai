future periods. During the year ended March 31, 2025, no cash and cash
equivalents were repatriated from a foreign subsidiary that were subject to income taxes, compared to $250,000 of
cash and cash equivalents repatriated during the year ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, and 2024, we
have $481,836 and $263,820, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries, a portion of
which may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes if it were to be repatriated. We continue to evaluate our
cash repatriation strategy and currently anticipate repatriating current and future unremitted earnings of non-US
subsidiaries to the extent they have been subject to US income tax, if such cash is not required to fund ongoing
foreign operations. Refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this
Annual Report for further information regarding our cash repatriation strategy.
For the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we did not generate significant pre-tax earnings from
any countries which do not impose a corporate income tax. A small portion of our unremitted accumulated earnings
of non-US subsidiaries, for which no US federal or state income tax have been paid, are currently expected to be
reinvested outside of the US indefinitely. Such earnings would become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these
subsidiaries.
Revolving Credit Facilities. Information about our revolving credit facilities available as of March 31, 2025, is as
follows:
• Primary Credit Facility. We have a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides for
borrowings up to $400,000 (Primary Credit Facility) and contains a $25,000 sublimit for the
issuance of letters of credit. Under the Primary Credit Facility, there is no outstanding balance,
$399,045 of available borrowings, and $955 of outstanding letters of credit.
• China Credit Facility. We have an uncommitted revolving line of credit of up to CNY300,000, or
$41,338, with an overdraft facility sublimit of CNY100,000, or $13,779 (China Credit Facility). There
is no outstanding balance, outstanding bank guarantees of $455, and available borrowings of
$40,883 under the China Credit Facility.
• Debt Covenants. We are in compliance with all financial covenants under our Primary Credit Facility
and China Credit Facility.
Refer to Note 6, “Revolving Credit Facilities,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this
Annual Report for further information on the terms of our revolving credit facilities.
Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include working capital, payments to fulfill
contractual obligations, capital expenditures, and stock repurchases. Our working capital requirements begin when
we purchase raw and other materials and inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting trade
accounts receivable. Given the historical seasonality of the UGG brand, our working capital requirements fluctuate
significantly throughout our fiscal year, and we utilize available cash to build inventory levels during certain quarters
to support higher selling seasons. While the impact of seasonality has been mitigated to some extent, we expect our
working capital requirements will continue to fluctuate from period to period.
