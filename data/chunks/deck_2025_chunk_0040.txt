ior period. Units sold include all categories such as footwear, apparel,
accessories, home goods, and care kits.
Gross Profit. Gross margin increased to 57.9% from 55.6%, compared to the prior period, primarily due to
favorable brand and product mix, with higher margin product driving a higher proportion of growth, and increased
levels of full-price selling primarily for the UGG brand, including reduced closeouts to the wholesale channel,
partially offset by unfavorable changes in freight costs.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Drivers of significant net changes in SG&A expenses,
compared to the prior period, were as follows:
• Increased advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses of approximately $83,300, primarily due
to higher promotional marketing expenses for the HOKA and UGG brands to drive global brand
awareness and market share gains, highlight new product categories, and provide localized
marketing.
• Increased other SG&A expenses of approximately $79,800, primarily due to higher unallocated
enterprise and shared brand expenses of approximately $46,400 for 3PL service fees, contract
services, IT programming and software costs, and other operating expenses; higher HOKA brand
expenses of approximately $22,700 for materials and supplies, sales commissions, travel costs,
bad debt expenses, credit card fees, and other operating expenses; and higher UGG brand
expenses of approximately $9,700 for sales commissions, bad debt expenses, and credit card fees.
• Increased payroll and related costs of approximately $67,800, primarily due to higher headcount
from investments in talent for the HOKA brand, enterprise functions, and the UGG brand, along with
higher variable payroll costs to support higher sales.
• Increased depreciation and other related costs of approximately $10,800, primarily due to higher
unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses for infrastructure investments and related
depreciation, partially offset by lower impairments.
• Increased rent and occupancy of approximately $8,800, primarily due to higher rent expenses
resulting from retail store footprint expansion for the HOKA brand.
• Increased net foreign currency-related remeasurement gains of approximately $2,000, primarily due
to favorable changes in Asian exchange rates against the US dollar.
