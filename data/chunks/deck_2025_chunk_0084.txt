NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Stock Repurchase Program. The Board has approved various authorizations under the Company’s stock
repurchase program to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors (collectively, the stock
repurchase program). As of March 31, 2025, the Board last approved an authorization of $1,200,000 on July 27,
2022, to repurchase its common stock under the same conditions as the prior stock repurchase program. As of
March 31, 2025, the aggregate remaining approved amount under the stock repurchase program is $374,701. The
stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any amount of common stock and may be
suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion.
Stock repurchase activity under the Company’s stock repurchase program was as follows:

NOTE 11. BASIC AND DILUTED SHARES
The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding was as follows:

Basic 151,992,000 155,225,000 159,023,000

LTIP PSUs 155,000 291,000 453,000
Deferred Non-Employee Director Equity Awards 2,000 3,000 11,000
Excluded Awards. The equity awards excluded from the calculation of the dilutive effect may be excluded due
to one of the following: (1) the shares were antidilutive or (2) the necessary conditions had not been satisfied for the
shares to be deemed issuable based on the Company’s performance for the relevant performance period. The
number of shares stated for each of these excluded awards is the maximum number of shares issuable pursuant to
these awards. For those awards subject to the achievement of performance criteria, the actual number of shares to
be issued pursuant to such awards will be based on Company performance in future periods, net of forfeitures, and
may be materially lower than the number of shares presented, which could result in a lower dilutive effect. Refer to
Note 8, “Stock-Based Compensation,” for further information on the Company’s equity incentive plans.
NOTE 12. REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS
Information reported to the CODM is organized into the Company’s three reportable operating segments,
which include the brand operations for the UGG brand, HOKA brand, and Other brands. The operations of each
brand within these reportable operating segments are managed separately because each requires different
marketing, research and development, design, sourcing, and sales strategies.
The Company does not regularly provide total assets or capital expenditures information by reportable
operating segment to the CODM because that information is not used to evaluate performance or allocate
resources to each reportable operating segment.
Segment Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Income from Operations.
