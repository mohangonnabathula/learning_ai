 the amount of the
allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged trade accounts receivable, economic conditions and
forecasts, historical experience, and the customers’ creditworthiness. Trade accounts receivable that are
subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance. The allowance
includes specific allowances for trade accounts, for which all or a portion are identified as potentially uncollectible
based on known or anticipated losses. Additions to the allowance represent bad debt expense estimates which are
recorded in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Inventories. Inventories, which are primarily comprised of finished goods on hand and in transit, are stated at
the lower of cost (weighted moving average) or net realizable value at each financial statement date. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs to sell. The
Company regularly reviews inventory for excess, obsolete, and impaired inventory to evaluate write-downs to the
lower of cost or realizable value.
Cloud Computing Arrangements (CCAs). The Company enters into various CCAs that are governed by service
contracts (hosting arrangements) to support operations. Application development stage implementation costs
(implementation costs) of a hosting arrangement are deferred and recorded to prepaid expenses and other assets
in the consolidated balance sheets. Implementation costs are expensed on a straight-line basis and recorded in
SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the term of the hosting
arrangement, including reasonably certain renewals, which are generally one to three years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(amounts in thousands, except per share and share data)
As of March 31, 2025, net capitalized costs for CCAs are $6,031, with $2,167 recorded in prepaid expenses
and $3,864 recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2024, net capitalized costs
for CCAs are $4,537, with $1,534 recorded in prepaid expenses and $3,003 recorded in other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets. Refer to the section titled “Recoverability of Definite-Lived Intangible and Other Long-
Lived Assets” below, within this footnote, for detail on an impairment of a CCA recorded during the year ended
March 31, 2025.
Property and Equipment, Depreciation and Amortization. Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization, and generally have a useful life of at least one year. Property and
equipment include tangible, non-consumable items owned by the Company. Software implementation costs are
capitalized if they are incurred during the application development stage and relate to costs to obtain computer
software from third parties, including related consulting expenses, or costs incurred to modify existing software that
results in additional upgrades or enhancements that provide additional functionality.
Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized to their residual value, if any, on the straight-line basis over their
estimated economic useful lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Changes in the estimate of the useful life of
an asset may occur after an asset is placed in service. For example, this may occur as a result of the Company
incurring costs that prolong the useful life of an asset, which would be recorded as an adjustment to depreciation
over the revised remaining useful life. Depreciation and amortization are recorded in SG&A expenses in the
consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Property and equipment, net, are summarized as follows:
As of March 31,

over the reasonably certain lease term.
