Recent Tax Law Changes. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (commonly known
as OECD) has released Pillar Two model rules introducing a 15% global minimum tax rate for large multinational
corporations to be effective starting with tax periods ending in 2024. Various jurisdictions in which the Company
operates have enacted or plan to enact legislation beginning in calendar year 2024 or in subsequent years. The
enactment of Pillar Two legislation did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated statements of
comprehensive income during the current period. The Company will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of
such legislative changes in future periods, as each of the respective jurisdictions enact the legislation and the
legislation becomes effective.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits. When tax returns are filed, some positions taken are subject to uncertainty about
the merits of the position taken or the amount that would be ultimately sustained upon examination. The benefit of a
tax position is recorded in the consolidated financial statements during the period in which the Company believes it
is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The recognition
threshold is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon
settlement. The portion of the benefit that exceeds the amount measured, as described above, is recorded as a
liability for unrecognized tax benefits, along with any associated interest and penalties, in the consolidated balance
sheets.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of total gross unrecognized tax benefits are as follows:
Years Ended March 31,
2025 2024 2023
Beginning balance $ 45,620 $ 44,901 $ 24,779
Gross increase related to current year tax positions 4,499 4,318 6,865
Gross increase related to prior year tax positions 4,662 4,629 16,243
Gross decrease related to prior year tax positions (4,309) (4,698) (456)
Settlements with taxing authorities (22,793) (582) —
Lapse of statute of limitations (6,446) (2,948) (2,530)
Ending balance $ 21,233 $ 45,620 $ 44,901
Total gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
As of March 31,
2025 2024
Current liability
Income tax payable $ 5,688 $ 3,998
Long-term liability
Income tax liability 15,545 41,622
Total $ 21,233 $ 45,620
Net unrecognized tax benefits are defined as gross unrecognized tax benefits, less federal benefit for state
income taxes, related to uncertain tax positions taken in the Company’s income tax return that would impact the
Company’s effective tax rate, if recognized. Management believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of net
unrecognized tax benefits, as well as associated interest and penalties, may decrease during the next 12 months by
$2,858, which includes amounts relating to expirations of statute of limitations and settlements of various tax
matters. Of this amount, $2,649 would result in an income tax benefit for the Company and $209 would result in a
decrease to interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
As of March 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company has accrued $3,424 and $6,314 for the payment of interest and
penalties, respectively, in income tax liability in the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended March 31,
2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded $(2,890), $486, and $1,106, respectively, of interest and penalties as
a (decrease) or increase to interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

The Company has on-going income tax examinations in various state and foreign tax jurisdictions and
regularly assesses tax positions taken during years open to examination. The Company files income tax returns in
the US federal jurisdiction and various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no
longer subject to US federal, state, local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities before fiscal year
2021.
Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable and prepares its tax filings in accordance with
all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be
materially different from the Company’s estimates or from its historical income tax provisions and accruals.
