• Increased depreciation and other related costs of approximately $16,100, primarily due to higher
unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses for infrastructure investments and related
depreciation, as well as an impairment for Sanuk brand definite-lived intangible assets.
• Decreased net foreign currency-related remeasurement losses of approximately $2,900, primarily
due to favorable changes in Canadian and Asian exchange rates against the US dollar.

presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment. Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments
Overview,” above for further information on the recent change in our reportable operating segments.
(2) To the extent that consolidated SG&A expenses exceed reportable operating segment SG&A expenses, the costs are
recorded in unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses, which are costs that are managed centrally and not
specific to any one brand. The change in reportable operating segments had an impact on segment income from
operations, a measure of segment profitability, and a clarification was made that certain prior unallocated overhead costs
are defined as unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses and are excluded from the measure of segment
profitability.
The increase in total income from operations, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due
to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.
Drivers of significant net changes in total income from operations, compared to the year ended March 31,
2023, were as follows:
• The increase in income from operations of the UGG brand was due to higher net sales at higher
gross margins, partially offset by slightly higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.
• The increase in income from operations of the HOKA brand was due to higher net sales at higher
gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.
• The decrease in income from operations of the Other brands was primarily due to lower net sales at
higher gross margins, as well as higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, primarily due
to the Sanuk brand definite-lived intangible asset impairment.
• The increase in unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses was primarily due to higher
payroll and related costs for higher headcount for enterprise functions along with higher variable
payroll costs to support higher sales, including performance-based compensation; higher other
SG&A expenses for IT programming and software costs, 3PL service fees, legal fees, contract
services, and travel costs; higher depreciation and other related costs for infrastructure
investments; and higher rent and occupancy for enterprise offices.

Total Other Income, Net. The increase in total other income, net, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023,
was due to higher interest income from higher invested cash balances and average interest rates.
Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense and our effective income tax rate were as follows:
Years Ended March 31,
2024 2023
Income tax expense $ 219,378 $ 149,260
Effective income tax rate 22.4 % 22.4 %
Our effective income tax rate was flat compared to the year ended March 31, 2023. The current year income
tax rate is primarily driven by US domestic taxes resulting from an increase in US domestic pre-tax income, offset by
the foreign rate differential. The rate for the year ended March 31, 2023, was primarily driven by the impact on the
foreign rate differential of nonrecurring income tax benefits related to foreign tax-exempt income, offset by an
increase in income tax expense for lower unrealized tax benefits related to foreign tax authority assessments.
Net Income. The increase in net income, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to
higher net sales, operating margins, and interest income. Net income per share increased, compared to the year
ended March 31, 2023, due to higher net income and lower weighted-average common shares outstanding driven
by stock repurchases.
