Employee Stock Purchase Plans. In September 2015, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2015
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2015 ESPP), which authorized 6,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock
for sale to eligible employees using after-tax payroll deductions, which are refundable until purchases are made,
and are liability-classified. Following the issuance of shares under the 2015 ESPP to employees who participated in
the offering period ended February 28, 2025, the 2015 ESPP was terminated, and no new offering periods under
the 2015 ESPP will commence.
In September 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2024
ESPP), which replaced the 2015 ESPP. The 2024 ESPP reserves 6,000,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock for sale to eligible employees. The terms of the 2024 ESPP are substantially similar to the terms of the 2015
ESPP. Each offering period under the 2024 ESPP is anticipated to run for approximately six months with purchases
occurring on the last day of each offering period (no look-back provision) at a 15% discount to the closing price on
that date. The first offering period commenced on March 1, 2025. As a result of the stock split, the number of shares
of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2024 ESPP were adjusted proportionately.
