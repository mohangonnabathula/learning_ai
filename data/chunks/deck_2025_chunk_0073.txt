NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023
(amounts in thousands, except per share and share data)
No definite-lived intangible asset triggering events were identified during the years ended March 31, 2025, and
2023. During the year ended March 31, 2024, an impairment loss of $8,164 was recorded within the Other brands
reportable operating segment in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the
Sanuk brand definite-lived trademark, driven by lower-than-expected results of operations for the wholesale channel
that resulted in the carrying value exceeding the estimated fair value, which was determined based on an estimate
of the future discounted cash flows.
NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value, which is
defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in
the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. The fair value hierarchy under this accounting standard requires an entity to maximize the use
of observable inputs, where available.
The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required:
• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities.
• Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring the
Company to develop its own assumptions.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial instruments, which principally include cash and cash
equivalents, trade accounts receivable, net, trade accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued expenses,
approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. When the Company makes short-term borrowings, the
carrying amounts, which are considered Level 2 liabilities, approximate fair value based upon current rates and
terms available to the Company for similar debt. The Company does not currently have any Level 3 assets or
liabilities.
