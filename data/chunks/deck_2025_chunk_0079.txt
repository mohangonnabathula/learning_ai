ent of the related sales target is reasonably likely to occur. Other variable lease
payments, such as tax, CAM, and insurance, are recognized in rent expense as incurred. Some leases contain one
fixed lease payment that include variable lease payments, which are considered non-lease components. The
Company has elected to account for these instances as a single lease component and the total of these fixed
payments is used to measure the operating lease assets and lease liabilities.
Discount Rate. The Company discounts its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease
or, if the rate cannot be readily determined, its IBR. Generally, the Company cannot determine the interest rate
implicit in the lease because it does not have access to the lessor’s estimated residual value or the amount of the
lessor’s deferred initial direct costs. The Company has a centralized treasury function, which enables the Company
to use a portfolio approach to discount lease obligations. Therefore, the Company generally derives a discount rate
at the lease commencement date by utilizing its IBR, which is based on what the Company would have to pay on a
collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to its lease payments under similar terms. Because the Company
does not currently borrow on a collateralized basis under its revolving credit facilities, it uses the interest rate it pays
on its non-collateralized borrowings under its Primary Credit Facility as an input for deriving an appropriate IBR,
adjusted for the amount of the lease payments, the lease term, and the effect on that rate of designating specific
collateral with a value equal to the unpaid lease payments for that lease.

Product. As of March 31, 2025, the Company has $956,911 of outstanding purchase orders or other obligations
with independent third-party contractors that manufacture all of its products (independent manufacturers). These
obligations consist mostly of open purchase orders that are expected to be fulfilled in the ordinary course of

cancelled by the Company under certain circumstances; however, the occurrence of such circumstances is
generally limited. As a result, the amount does not necessarily reflect the dollar amount of the Company’s binding
commitments or minimum purchase obligations for products, and instead reflects an estimate of its future payment
commitments based on information currently available.
