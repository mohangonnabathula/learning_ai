DIVIDEND POLICY
We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception. Our current
revolving credit agreements allow us to declare and pay cash dividends, as long as we do not exceed certain
leverage ratios, and no event of default has occurred. However, we currently do not anticipate declaring or paying
any cash dividends.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Our Board has approved various authorizations under our stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of
our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions,
applicable legal requirements, and other factors (collectively, the stock repurchase program). As of March 31, 2025,
our Board last approved an authorization of $1,200,000 on July 27, 2022.
Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock and may be
suspended at any time at our discretion. The credit agreements governing our revolving credit facilities allow us to
make stock repurchases under this program, so long as we do not exceed certain leverage ratios. As of March 31,
2025, we have not exceeded the stated leverage ratios, and no defaults have occurred under these credit
agreements.
