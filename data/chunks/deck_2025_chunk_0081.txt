based restricted stock units
(PSUs), LTIP PSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, incentive stock options (ISOs), and non-qualified
stock options (NQSOs).
In September 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2024 Stock Incentive Plan (2024 SIP), which is
intended to replace the 2015 SIP. Like the 2015 SIP, the primary purpose of the 2024 SIP is to encourage ownership
in the Company by key personnel, whose long-term service is considered essential to the Company’s continued
success. As a result of the stock split, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2024
SIP and the number of shares underlying outstanding equity awards and the exercise price of stock options were
adjusted proportionately.
The 2024 SIP initially reserves 7,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for issuance to employees,
directors, consultants, independent contractors, and advisors, less one share for every one share granted under the
2015 SIP after March 31, 2024 and prior to September 9, 2024, the effective date of the 2024 SIP, subject to an
increase from the return of shares under the 2015 SIP as described below. The terms of the 2024 SIP are
substantially similar to the terms of the 2015 SIP. The 2024 SIP provides for the issuance of a variety of stock-based
compensation awards, including RSUs, PSUs, LTIP PSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, ISOs, and
NQSOs. The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued to employees under the 2024 SIP through
the exercise of ISOs is 4,500,000.

The Company will not grant any further equity awards under the 2015 SIP. Outstanding awards under the 2015
SIP will remain outstanding, unchanged and subject to the terms of the 2015 SIP and their respective award
agreements. Shares subject to awards that are forfeited, expire or are otherwise terminated without shares being
issued, or shares withheld to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy tax withholding obligations, including
shares subject to awards granted under the 2015 SIP that are outstanding after March 31, 2024, will be returned to
the pool of shares available for grant and issuance under the 2024 SIP. As of March 31, 2025, 7,793,719 shares of
common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2024 SIP, subject to adjustment for future stock
splits, stock dividends, and similar changes in capitalization.
Annual Stock Awards. During the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company granted RSU
and LTIP PSU awards to certain members of the Company’s management team, which entitle the recipients to
receive shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting. No dividends are paid or accumulated on any RSU
or LTIP PSU awards.

Restricted Stock Units. RSUs are subject to a time-based vesting condition and typically vest in equal annual
installments over three years following the date of grant.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards. LTIP PSU awards are subject to market, performance, and time-based
vesting conditions. The term of LTIP PSU awards is over a multi-fiscal year performance period with metrics
established at the beginning of the performance period, which is generally two or three years (Measurement
Period). The LTIP PSU awards include a market condition tied to the Company’s relative total stockholder return
(TSR) in relation to its peer companies (peer market condition), as well as financial performance conditions tied to
certain revenue and pre-tax income performance targets (financial performance conditions).
