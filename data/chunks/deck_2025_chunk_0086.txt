(1) The significant expense categories and amounts align with the segment-level information that is regularly provided to the
CODM.
(2) Depreciation and other related costs generally includes depreciation of property and equipment, amortization and
impairment of intangible assets or other-long lived assets, accretion, loss on disposal of assets, and other miscellaneous
costs. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment to intangible assets of $8,164 for the
Sanuk brand definite-lived trademark. Refer to Note 3, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” for further information on the
impairment loss.
(3) Other segment items are comprised of other SG&A expenses, which primarily includes credit card fees, commissions,
materials and supplies, travel, and certain 3PL service fees.
A reconciliation of reportable segment income from operations to consolidated statements of comprehensive
income was as follows:
Years Ended March 31,
2025 2024 2023
Segment income from operations $ 1,885,956 $ 1,547,595 $ 1,150,429
Unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses (1) (706,864) (620,081) (497,678)
Total other income, net 64,207 51,427 13,331
Consolidated income before income taxes $ 1,243,299 $ 978,941 $ 666,082
(1) To the extent that consolidated SG&A expenses exceed reportable operating segment SG&A expenses, the costs are
recorded in unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses, which are costs that are managed centrally and not
specific to any one brand. The change in reportable operating segments had an impact on segment income from
operations, a measure of segment profitability, and a clarification was made that certain prior unallocated overhead costs
are defined as unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses and are excluded from the measure of segment
profitability.
