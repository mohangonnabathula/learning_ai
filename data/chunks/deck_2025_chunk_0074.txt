approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. When the Company makes short-term borrowings, the
carrying amounts, which are considered Level 2 liabilities, approximate fair value based upon current rates and
terms available to the Company for similar debt. The Company does not currently have any Level 3 assets or
liabilities.
Assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets
are as follows:

The Company’s non-financial assets, such as other long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets, which
include operating lease assets, machinery and equipment, leasehold improvements, definite-lived trademarks; as
well as indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis
and are reported at carrying value. Instead, these assets are tested for impairment annually, or when an event
occurs or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When determining fair
value, Level 3 measurements are used for the estimates and assumptions, including undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset groups based upon historical experience, expected market conditions, as
well and management’s plans.
